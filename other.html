                        established by Malcolm Dorfman Shihan (Dojo of Karatenomichi South Africa, based in Parktown
                        North) for 6 years for pocket money.
                        I worked with students from 6 until 16 years old throughout the course of my teaching and
                        training. Some students I had for the full 6 years as shown in the images.

                    <p style="margin: 5px;">During the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, I created an online print-on-demand
                        shop. Designs that I created, or in some instances recreated from stencils found on the
                        internet, I placed on some form of
                        apparel. Those designs would then be hosted on a platform by the name of Teespring. To help get
                        more sales I started a social media account for my store by the name of grant.caliber. <a
